			<h2><span>1. </span>Pack everything you think that can help you to achieve it.</h2><br><br>
				The first tip is to look for everthing that can help you to acheive your goals. Look for money that can fund your goals, materials that you will need, and other things necessary to acheive your goals. 
				<br><br>For example, if you want to learn to code, make sure that your Laptop is working well. If you are in need of learning construction, make sure that your building materials are ready to go. If you want to 
				achieve success in photography accumulate everything you may need like Camera, phone, and other photo editing tools.<br><br> After accumulating them, put them together until you feel that you are ready to go.
				After this, you won't stack in your way, you will be having all materials available. Each day we are dreaming about our goals. Each day we are moving forward, step closer to the success. Sometimes we are so focused on our objectives that we don't have time to think why we desire success.<br><br>
				What is the reason? Do we really need it? Is it coming from the conscious or unconscious part of our mind?
				I have a simple exercise for you, my friend. Don’t worry; it doesn’t require you to move away from screen and it will take no more than few minutes.
				<br><br>Just relax and focus thoughts on your latest success you have achieved. It doesn’t have to be something really big and outstanding. A small success that you have recently experienced is absolutely enough.
				<br><br>Ok, got it?<br><br>
				Imagine that achieving success is like a journey; sometimes it can be quite easy, sometimes really tough, can be also short or very long. Let’s figure out why you took this journey and what helped you to accomplish it.
				Jump in your memories to the point where your journey began. Recall feelings and emotions connected to this moment. What was the reason you decided to set yourself this goal?
				<br><br><b>How did you take your first step?</b><br><br>
				While moving your thoughts on the path toward your goal, try to identify factors that motivated you and increased your energy to go forward. Look also for those who obstructed your journey.
				<br><br>How did you cope with them?<br><br>
				Finally, arrive to your destination point.
				What did you feel when you succeed? Were you truly happy or maybe disappointed as the goal didn’t bring you satisfaction and fulfillment?
				Don’t worry if above questions was difficult for you. To help you answering them, I share with you the six main reasons, which I identify why we want to achieve success.
